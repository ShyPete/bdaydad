# Project Context

## Summary
Simple vibecoded birthday web app for Dad. The app ends by wishing him a happy
birthday.

## Current concept
1) Data-collection adventure with branching responses (choose-your-own-adventure).
2) Intentional, playful "broken app" moments (fake errors).

## Rough roadmap
1) Intro: Present "BirthdayBot5000" that claims it can determine if today is the
   user's birthday.
2) Initial prompt: Tries to ask for the user's birthday, but fails in a silly
   way (system crash or UI hell makes it impossible to answer).
3) Fake crash: The app appears to break, then reboots into "safe mode." or some other weird glitchy mode.
4) Safe mode: Attempts to infer the birthday using playful questions tied to
   Dad's interests and answers.
5) Finale: Reveals the result and wishes Dad a happy birthday.

## Goals
- Make the flow delightful and personal.
- Keep the experience short and snappy.
