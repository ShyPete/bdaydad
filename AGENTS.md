# Agents

This file captures shared agent guidance for this repo. Keep it short and update it
whenever scope, tone, or constraints change.

## Product intent
- Fun, playful vibecoded birthday app for Dad.
- End experience should clearly wish him a happy birthday.

## Experience pillars
- Choose-your-own-adventure flow that asks questions and branches on responses.
- Lighthearted "fake broken" moments (intentional errors) that resolve quickly.
- Target runtime: 3–5 minutes.

## Tone and style
- Warm, funny, and a bit glitchy.
- Short screens and punchy copy.

## Guardrails
- Keep it family friendly and positive.
- Any "error" screens must be obviously safe and reversible.

## When updating
- Add new features, flow notes, and tech decisions here.
- Keep personal facts in sync with project context.
